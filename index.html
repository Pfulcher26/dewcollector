    <h2>Mars Halls</h2>
    <br>
    <p>I'm stuck in Marshall's.  Marshall's at the mall.  But the lettering on the first half of the sign is out, so that it just says Hall’s.  Or Mars Hall's.  Whatever.  This isn’t a communiqué for immediate assistance, I just kind of want to let you know how I’m doing.  I'm stuck in a hallway.  The hallway is cream colored.  I'm probably underground.  It is a creamy subterranean hallway if the police ask.  I saw one cricket in here.  If the police ask, it is a creamy subterranean hallway and I saw one cricket in here.  That's it.  There are no doors.  Not really even any splits in the concrete.  It's been definitely over an hour, but probably less than three hours.  It's hard to tell.  Even when I wasn't stuck in Marshall's it was hard to tell.  Sometimes at work I'd be like, its definitely been an hour, and only fifteen minutes had passed.  That's the way it goes.  I'm not particularly bored.  This is a hallway, so there's not what I would call a lack of things to do.  It's just all the same kind of stuff.  When I first discovered I was stuck, I stopped everything I was doing, I slowed my breathing and whispered so that only I could hear, 'This is beyond my grief, beyond my pleasure."  I'm not sure what that means.  There's a security camera in one corner with a single cobweb attached to it, but I haven't seen any spider, and other than that there's nothing in the hallway.  The only other thing in the hallway is the cricket.  The cricket and the old office chair in the corner opposite the security camera.  The cricket was somewhere in the middle of the hallway.  It's a long hallway.  It probably takes thirty minutes to walk from one end to the other.  But here again, I'm not good with time.  When I draw angles from one corner of the hallway to the other it's very narrow.  I'm talking very narrow angles.  What do they call those?  Oblique?  No such thing, I'm sure.  The cricket was brown.  I would tell you what kind of cricket, but I'm no good with physics.  I mean physiognomy.  I'm getting hungry.  Soon I'll have to grill a squash.  The only problem is that I lack a squash and the means to grill it.  Oh well.  I'm pretty good at not eating.  If this was a Sears this would never have happened, or maybe it would have, maybe it would have been worse.  I have dreams, one might say intense nightmares, about dying in a Sears.  Honestly, I should have followed my heart and gone to Ross.  But why worry?  I have no definite form.  The hallway is badly damaged, perhaps by a former war.  If I close my eyes I feel like I’m in a wetland.  A wetland somewhere on the border of Poland, though I’ve never been, only passed through in my mind.  Night will be coming soon.  Night in the hallway.  “They call my right hand the big seven, because it has seven fingers, and in my left hand is the dead sugar plumb I feed to the sick dog.”  That’s a joke between me and a friend.  The wind is starting to blow.  Soon I will need to cook a sun mushroom to protect myself from the cold.  Sweet taste.  Fragrance of almonds.  If I walk from one end of the hallway to the other it will be night.  By the time I return to the end from which I departed all the lights will have gone out.  It will be dark in the hallway.  Then I will have to crawl along the floor in the dark with my side pressed against the wall.  In times like these, I remember life as it was before.  Life going ever on.  Life goes on forever.  Here in the Shire, life goes on as it ever does.  I wake up with nothing much to do but bake bread.  I bake bread until eleven.  Then it’s time for a snack.  We call it elevenses.  After elevenses, I got out and pet horses for the better part of two hours.  Then it’s time to get high and watch the clouds pass.  The finest leaf in all the Toby.  The hallway will soon be dark.  There is a wind blowing.  It occurs to me now that shoes would have come in handy.  Shoes and a tiny George Foreman grill.  With the grill of George Foreman I would have grilled things to increase my stamina.  Walking from one end of the hallway to the other for hours on end is draining.  No less on the mind.  I need drugs to increase my mental alertness.  Will you allow me the word acuity?  I’m leaving out the big words for now, though I have them.  Castrametation.  I bet you didn’t see that coming.  Shall I describe to you the castrametation of the hallway?  It’s long and narrow and goes on for a little while.  It takes me about thirty minutes to walk from one end to the other, though that’s probably inaccurate. It takes me about an hour to crawl from one end of the hallway to the other in the dark.  You cannot see my face during these times.  It is hidden like a canister.  My similes are becoming increasingly desperate.  I would like a little piece of fruit.  Or one, or more cookies accompanied by a drink of chocolate milk.  Chocolate milk does sound delicious.  It sounds almost as good as a smoke.  A smoko break as they call them in Australia.  A smoke and a rest on the way to the goldfields.  Could it be that I’m on my way to the goldfields?  Could it be that I’m already a part of the Australian Women’s Land Army.  Here we are resting in golden grasses while our husbands are away at war.  If my husband goes away to war I hope he never comes back.  I don’t mean that I want him to die, but rather that he would just decide not to come back.  He decides to stay on an island somewhere in the Pacific.  Go AWOL.  Hide among the bushes.  The beets and tubers.  No one tells him the war is over and he needs to come back, so he doesn’t.  He learns the names of tropical fish, but the indigenous names of the islanders.  He gets a facial tattoo and marries another.  He dies in a thunderstorm, or volcanic eruption of significant force.  Whatever, whatever.  The point is that I’m no longer a goldfish.  I’m free.  You get what I’m saying right?  It doesn’t matter.  I don’t care.  I do care, but it doesn’t matter.  It’s insignificant.  But night is falling, the wind is blowing, my children are coming.  Sky?  A George Foreman Grill, that’s all I require.  And yet sometimes at night with my hand against the glass, my forehead growing cold, it seems to me that I really did get a George Foreman grill, and lived a long life with Suzanne frolicking amidst the sea towns, whipping ourselves with seaweeds on the lee, crawling then, straight up, leaping into the winds, into landlessness again, gnashing our teeth, but not quite, ocean perishing, but not quite, all this agony in vain.  But take heart.  Suzanne.  A George Foreman girl.  Landlessness.  Happiness.  “No, I was never that.”  Fly all hospitality.  Into landlessness.  Again.  Supper warm and ready, banging one’s head against the hearth stone.  Supper cold and collecting dew.  Kneel against the winds.  A George Foreman Grill.  Shun all hospitality.  The soul’s open sea.  Into landlessness.  Disaster averted.  Go AWOL amongst the natives.  Beets and tubers.  No face tattoo.  Marriage of another.  Dies like a worm.  A thunderstorm.  Dies like a man.  Lives like a warm bath.  Forlornly rushing.  All this agony in vain.  Take heart, take heart.  It’s dark in the hallway.  Was I speaking this whole time?  It’s dark.  Bristling.  Have I been whispering?  This whole time weeping?  Himematsutake.  Sweet and smelling of drupes.  An almond field in Iran.  Not a true nut.  But I am!  I am!  In truth a nut.  Turning all these dead malls into mega gardens.  Gardens growing in the bomb craters.  Majorca, bitch.  Majora’s Mask.  I will here embark upon a series of references that only some will understand.  But that’s how a reference works.  You either know it, or you don’t.  I just saw a lizard in the hallway!  I’m on red hot alert.  Those fuckers are not allowed back into my life under any circumstances.  Not after the last time.  All the lizards in the sun, lying on top of one another. Feeling sexy in the sun.  Rubbing their little bodies to Mark McGrath songs.  Sacrilege.  No!  No!  No!  I will not allow it.  Mark McGrath.  Mark McGuire.  Mark it down six.  And sometimes I wonder where in the word she is.  Carmen Sandiego.  I had one job.  I had one job and that was not to love her.  But I loved her.  She’s gone in the rushes of fragrance, evaporated into ozone.  I’ll never deliver the ring to the mouth of destruction now.  Call me Sam Wise Fuck-up.  And the worst thing is that I know that she, by which I mean Carmen, never found me strange and irresistible.  How I would have worked myself to the bone for her.  I would have been a puppet of the man for her, worn a little straw hat in the shape of a limpet and always had a circle of sweat marking my back.  I would have prostituted myself at Litlte Caeser’s as a bread stick roller for her.  I would have worked as a night manager at Holiday Inn.  I would have curbed my gum chewing habit.  I would have sought out tasteful discounts  At least I would have paid someone to do so on my behalf.  My working-man double.  I meet with him secretly in the ally between Little Caeser’s and Radio Shack with an envelope full of secrets.  But maybe Carmen would have become wise to the one I paid to impersonate me at work.  Maybe out of spite she would have run away with him, run away him with him to somewhere tropical, an island with many lizards.  Majorca!  Maybe that’s what happened.  The sun is coming up again.  Or it is still night.  The middle of night.  If I close my eyes I am in the rain strewn with cherry blossoms.  I’ve been there before.  To the mouth of a muddy river.  All this dead love comes flooding back like a parade of tealights.  The last catfish in the war on terror missing half its brain.  I want to be like that fish.  I hold my breath for as long a I can.  I’ll do this until I vomit.  And then come the white lights, the visions of antelope. Three living species of Asian Gazelles.  Stotting through the desert.  You’ve seen pictures before where the gazelle is poised in mid-jump, all four legs lifted from the earth, back slightly curved as if being lifted by an invisible hook, that’s what a stot is.  Yes, you feel it in your bones as well, pronking of restless spirits.  Valleys of e-commerce. Unseen transmitting of essences.  Little bodiless ticks, ghostly virgules, pale integers from some other dimension.  In Arabic the word for gazelle and love poem are the same.  I bend down and free the lizard from the metal husk it is trapped under.  You are free for the sake of Layla, for ever!  I walk the hallway through shadow-lights, quality of light like wet ash, always on patrol.  I’m moving like a cinereous fowl through the reeds.  When did I become a cinereous fowl?  No lizards falling in love on my watch, or in lust.  Only chaste reptiles under my percussive gaze.  Come away, my beloved/ and be like a gazelle/ or like a young stag/ on the spice laden mountains.  The song of songs.  The un-haunted country of the final poem.  If I close my eyes, I’m in a small orchard with a coterie of elves.  They are mostly ambivalent towards me.  There is no threat of seduction.  Their bodies are covered in a dusting of soil.   These are the unwashed children, hiding away from humanity.  They look like young farmers, except for the tails peeking out of their plain clothes.  Cinereous fowl.  Gaze upon me, Carmen!  See what greatness I have wrought out here in the tree fort, in these green dungeons we have dug and fastened with manmade rope.  See me with these dirty boys and girls lying in the meadows by the stream with lilies perched upon it, dipping a finger. See me grow a tail and disappear into the tunnels of the earth, never to be heard again.  Two can play the game you play.  Soon they will be asking, where in the world is that stupid fuck that lost the one, true ring on his way to deliver it to its most vital moment, because he fell in love with an elusive thief that travels effortlessly across time-zones dispatching henchman along the way?  Where is that asshole?  But isn’t it as in those stories, the ones where they always say, love saves the day?  Or else love destroys the whole fucking universe.  I’ve heard that said as well.  Alas!  Suzanne, Carmen, Gloria Estefan!  Reach out for me, Gloria!  Let us move our bodies to glorious conga rhythms.  This will be our final farewell, our ultimate adios.  You are like a volumizing shampoo for my soul,  maybe Rosemary scented, I found on sale at Whole Foods.  You are as a coffee scrub for my senses.  I feel the music getting stronger.  I am helpless to the fire of desire.  When I was young and could feel you all over as a poison of the poles, a little bit of data saved in the atom, this colored glass.  When I was young and consumed you in milligrams of land and vegetables, inhaled like a salt, that the earth has grown rare things, the periodicity of love.  Gloria, Gloria, forget all that.  Forget the poetry.  Flute player play on your flute chords, I know you want to get your thing off, but we don’t need it.  All we need is the percussion of our hearts.  Who’s the fuckin’ queen?  You are.  Here it may be worth noting, while my nose is still soft, that insects, as a collective, have only been through one mass-extinction.  My hand is shining and my head hurts, as updates are ready to be sent.  I am about the size of a dark-skinned plant-eater brushing past your knees at night next to the salad bar.  I told him, I told him the other day, I told him there was an ocean that died a long time ago, and that a new one grew in its place.  It seemed impossible to believe.  For how can an ocean disappear, cease to exist?  These things happen all the time my friend.  He didn’t want to believe me, as he was desperately trying to maintain his tenuous grip on reality as it is.  Reality as it is without the knowledge that a thing such as an ocean can die.  There is dripping now down the hall at all hours.  The rabbits got out of their cages.  Out of their cages and went into the allium.  I haven’t eaten in 72 hours.  I have wrapped all my shoes in aluminum.  I know the other side of this wall is another wall.  And beyond that one is another.  And the guards become of increasing severity as one passes.  I was out in the gravel courtyard a couple of days ago, stooping to collect bat wings for the big Christmas stew, when I captured this blurry image of someone on the horizon.  The Italian.  It must have been the Italian.  The scientist.  The one who studies underground ice fields?  Everywhere he walked, flowers bloomed from the ground, and the rain fell faster, and everything turned to rust.  Ugo and Coraddo out in the toxic waste fields talking special unit dimensions.  And it’s impossible to like Star Wars without lying to yourself these days.  Can’t you see?  Imitation is everywhere, everywhere.  It’s not a single author, it’s an endless stream, and while it may look cool, it ultimately drives you (out of your soul sense), and kills you, it will kill you in your soul—And who am I?  And what does it matter?  For I’m alive, aren’t I?  I’m here.  This is my life, and I live in it, or it lives in me, in each case, there is not time to replace this time, no time to come, no cryonic sleep, no lucid dream, no demure Englishmen to save me from these nightmares, no reconstructive facial surgeries, no Penelope Cruz, no Tom Cruise, red hallways down, down, I could begin an affair in the Italian language, but that would do little to quell the bats, to annihilate the skates, I get the feeling that I am growing out of my skin, that a super plume is ripping me apart, where are my companions, where is the cinematographer and the director, as I grow desperate, they begin to disappear into the boreal forests, leaving me alone, not alone.  Not alone.  I walked down the aisle in red socks.  I sat down in front.  We started laughing.  It doesn’t matter what about.

    <h2>militant in shades</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>I have been trying to draw your likeness onto the shield.  The shifting silverness of its presence reflects your smile.  This is the declaration of my intent.  Where are you, dear princess?  Are you extinct?  We together must subvert the legacy of failure.  I had a feeling you would leave.  At first I left.  No, first it went away.  Then I just went after it.  And after that, you left.  I had a feeling you would leave after I left.  It was time for me to leave the room again, so that I could return in three days once my letter of complaint was received and officially dealt with.  I was, however, ill prepared for what was outside the plaster. Perhaps an auroch, strolling leisurely across the university lawn, its heavy hooves paddling through the green, or the University Rector himself, my psycho-spiritual rival separated from me by a tiny channel of asphalt where the northern dormitories disappear and the office village begins proper under heavy shade of elm and oak.  Please don’t say I didn’t know you.  Didn’t at least give every breath of my blood in trying.  That would wound me worst of all.  I have a hard time speaking to people.  A feared cohort told me that there is a class of individuals known as ‘randoms’ that solicit people arbitrarily for conversation.  I tried to be ‘random’ at one point.  I walked on a bridge alongside an overpass, seeking out someone to speak with.  I failed.  I failed, though there were two eagles in the sky above me.  Some indigenous magic… An auric vibration in my innermost gels… I have lost it.  They say a hurricane is coming.  They say it has changed course, bypassing initial estimates, and is expected to make landfall in the middle of the campus.  It might not be a bad idea to prepare.  But whatever happens you can’t stop nature.   And I have still not managed to inscribe your face into the shield.  I told them, the police, or whoever they were, pretending to be whoever they weren’t, that I know nothing of any incidence of indecency in the rotunda.  When it happened I was by the office villages, beneath the shade of the Elms, the Oaks, too, flat on my belly, in the practice of watching lizards.  Perhaps they have mistaken me for one of their own.  Some dreary second-hand fletcher, spending all day attaching semi-flexible matter to shafts of arrows that outfly them, things whose ultimate fate one has no say over.  I remember now.  I remember how I met you outside of the arena.  There I was, hating state power, while you looked positively dashing in your university basketball police uniform.  I even thought of joining the basketball team, so that through some foul in my performance you might gently chastise me, but it was not to be.  At least not at first.  Though I felt your tantric vibrations.  I felt the soft wind in my belly.  I knew that from then on my bowels would flex only for you.  It is infinite.  It is infinitesimal.  I am still very eagerly trying to inscribe your face onto the shield without any luck.  Perhaps what I’m doing is too complex.  Instead of your face, maybe I should try to inscribe the feeling of the time that our hands were almost touching the outside of the healing circle.  Surely you remember that one?  We were sitting at the height of the stage.  No, that’s more complex. More complex.  I’m always doing more complex things.  And lately my anger has been especially hard to handle, my tenderness especially difficult to locate.  I will try to inscribe a scene that neither of us can recall then: A lizard and a berry, perhaps the lizard curled around the berry, or crawling amidst a patch of them.  Linguistically, I wonder, what is the difference between the two?  I am a bit worried over recent earnings.  The purpose is not as financial as material.  What I do hardly fills my days.  What can I do hard to fill my days?  Sale of drugs?  The thought occurred to me once, I put it off, and then it happened again and it kept happening to me… That I should use narcotics of various strength and usages in exchange for a cash prize… That I should not sell drugs, but do them and have others pay me for it.  But I’m too busy for that.  Too busy with the face and the shield that keeps on denying it.  But now it is time to say it.  Time to say now that I am in my safe space of Iowa.  Is this Iowa, or Japan?  I can never tell.  You’d think that the accents would give it away, but like I said, I am busy with my studies.  Too busy to notice regional dialect—Maybe I should be kinder.  Maybe I shouldn’t have talked to him.  Was I yelling?  Is it possible to yell without raising your voice, without even going so far as to speak?  I would like not to think.  I would prefer to think, on the contrary, of a beautiful gray sea town.  A place where they have no idea of me, or my history of yelling without talking, the elders in the town square having no knowledge of my history of hating underwear.  That’s what I was aiming to say, now that I’m here in a regionally vague place like Iowa, or Japan.  I’d like to say: I don’t hate Hanes.  Yesterday, as I lay on my belly, staring at the lizards foraging berries under the bushes near Blackwell Hall, I came across a rather strange sight of modern men engaged in some form of vigorous and intense activity.  Some had healing crystals around the neck.  Two of them got into a Mercedes Benz and left the area, presumably to go get pet food.  One of them claimed to have a family.  They repeatedly and often referred to each other as bro, which I took to be an extension of the familial brother, using phrases such as “We’ll always be bros, bro.”  Pleonasm not withstanding, I can admire the sentiment.   Still, I will try to be more cautious from now on when observing lizards, as one never knows the potential of the world to surprise.  It is truly a vast wilderness in which anything can happen.  But did I say yesterday?  Certainly by yesterday I meant three summers ago.  How quickly time flies, even when its wings are broken.   A while before, I was looking into the bottom of a busted ewer at a lizard that had died there.  Its tiny lips were stained in berry blood.  I picked it up and put it in my pocket determined to either eat it, or give it a proper burial somewhere further down the line.  I didn’t have the tools germane to digging a small grave, but I had buried lizards before and under less auspicious circumstances.  As such, the stress of burying the lizard was not weighing very heavily upon my mind when I came across her in the quadrilateral weaving something out of the air.  I say weaving something out of the air, but I think, in fact, she was involved in yogic practice.  I know nothing of yoga.  My specialty is lizards and berries, mostly lizards.  But I’m telling you, dear reader, I needed nothing of yoga on that lovely summer day to know I was completely and unequivocally in love.  The daylight was made of something like imperishable gold, as I walked across the quadrilateral with the dead lizard in my pocket.  I didn’t say anything to her specifically, but to me, the way in which I walked away from her quickly at a forty-five degree angle said it all: Love me and nothing else.  It is undoubtedly a strong idea to propose.  After all, we are not crabs, or lobsters, or whatever kind of abominable urchin that promises eternal marriage (Though it may be a different kind of thing than a crab, or lobster—the urchin—completely).  Without pausing to further assume of the urchin, I realize that my sentiment was overwrought and potentially damaging.  I also realized the seeming impossibility of the task at hand.  If I were going to convince her that she loved me, I would have to seriously consider practicing yoga.  That meant, for the time being at least, I would have to put the lizards on hold.  There were other technical considerations as well.  First, I had to find some way to time it out perfectly so that we each met on our stomachs while watching lizards.  That way we would have something to talk about in common.  Already it’s getting muddled.  I said I had to ignore lizards, not impose them on someone else.  There was also no guarantee that, if they were hiding, I would be able to attract the lizards from the depths of the shrubs.  In that case we might both be staring across empty space into each other’s eyes.  I was not yet ready to look into her eyes.  I was however ready to be at an angle obliquely removed from her.  The bleachers would probably be a better meeting place.  But what if it had recently rained?  It was then possible for one, or both of us to slip.  If she slipped and hurt herself, there was no promise that my strength alone would be enough to get her into emergency care.  In which case I would either have to perform the relevant first-aid procedures myself, or become too quickly intimate with the details of her personal life by relying on the help of her friends, who might be those of especially beautiful faces that know more about yoga than me—Although the primary consideration in all of this is safety.  If fractured ankles are not treated quickly there is all sorts of potential for further problems and long-term damage.  If her ankle were permanently damaged, her yoga practices may be obliterated.  She would always blame me without a doubt.  Of course I know nothing about how you, spirited reader, would react.  Falling in love is not something you plan, after all.  How long did it take me to learn that?  And to think that I likely made all that up—Not the part about the berries of course, but the part of my unrequited love.  Is solitude to be both my blessing and my curse long as I shall live?  I have lost my enthusiasm for the shield at present.  I should be on to other things, like preparing to leave.  There is still quite a lot to do in order to be present when they arrive.  I have to burn all the underwear in a big tub on the stoop.  And after that I have to check the house to see if there are any lizards left.  I’ve brought in so many over the years and they have mostly escaped.  However, there may be one, or two milling around.  That’s what I’ll do.  I’m going to do that.  Very quickly.  There is something about his face, like the lower albedo of lunar maria that casts them in shadow compared to the radiance of the surrounding landscape—Something that leads me to believe that I do not have the ability to deal with him in a one on one conflict.  I’ve looked into that face before and never looked past the shadow.  I’m sure that if that shadow went away all that would be left is a hell of infinite torment.  I hide in the attic.  I reach the small rectangle in the ceiling not a foot to the right of the shower via a thin folding ladder, which I will pull up behind.  The interior of the ceiling is dark and narrow, not three feet high, although there is a small square window to look out into the courtyard below.  There I stay, in my moldy space pod.  I stuff my pockets with lizards to maintain my strength.  I design a system for collecting the dew on the windows, and watch them come and go, frosty figures rolling through shrubs of wintergreen.  What do I mean by rolling?  My pulse is rising.  I’m going to take a break from freaking out by imagining an old house.  Its wood panels flaking like scales, shaking like old blades at the approach.  Cinderblock steps up to the slanted porch, screen ripped from the door, a small brown acorn with a rust colored head waiting in the seam between the door and the dust of the house’s inside.  The sun sets in the field around the house and the fireworks begin to ripple on the far horizon as small as spacecraft.  But the reverie couldn’t hold.  In the whites of his eyes I begin to fear for the number, the rolling black cords, the pale integers twinkling in the abyss, blank numbers in the throat.  My peaceful jumper begins to glow, and I feel myself starting to float, my face takes on the paleness of moon rocks and I grow faint.  My eyes close.  Lizards all dancing and swirling around the sound of metal wings colliding over a pile of trash, spinning through a huge spiritual waste.  I wonder why she decided to give up on us?  Do you see it in my hands?  Can you hear it in my heart?  And is it the same for you in your heart?  That each time it falls out of itself must sum an infinity.  There is elastic in our cells that can move the planets, which call to the universe.  So why not reply to my message?  Are you too busy trying to cure cancer?  That must be it.  Incredible Libra.  Harmony, symmetry, air, scales, inanimacy.  Why could you love me in some languages, but not the rest?  Why must you try so hard to save everyone?  Stop looking for solutions to HIV.  Come and see me.  I know that is selfish, but I’ve bought us matching jumpsuits.  We will be the two most handsome Zebra Fish in the entire city, the country, the world, and the universe. If it is true that all one wants is for what is right and true according to the fates, or something like a destiny, then what are you waiting for, come and advocate for what is rightfully yours.  Alas, I send you longing, you send me air and blades.  So much air, which contains such blades.  Now don’t scream as though you’ve just found out the sugar you swallowed was actually ant poison when I tell you this, but we could be just like those dick cats that live mostly in true deserts, sandy and stony vistas, far flung from water, our people fragmented and small, long hair covering the soles of our feet… I was at home last night.  I stood on the porch and looked into the life I’ve always wanted.  But do I really want that?  Isn’t it better to visit and leave it intact like a beautiful dream? And in his departure, this dream swept away like the dust of a butterfly’s wings.  What tiny fragment will remain to serve as a representation of the life they shared?  I may be alone in the desert, my sandy fur pale in yellow light, faint neck, spotted and greenish throat, yellow eyes ringed white, dirt encircling black nose, narrow red lines running from outer corner of each eye across the cheek where my teary tears have flowed, serving as the unlikely holotype of a love that I belonged to more than I ever knew possible.  All the while I will rasp for you in the stony desert, with my radio collar.  If you do not come for me by the crepuscular hour, I will return back under my graveyard, retreat back beneath the burrow, which, to be totally forthcoming, was excavated not by me, but porcupine.  
Would it offend you to live in an old porcupine home with my toxic mega colon and me?  

Though otherwise of medium intestinal value, I will do my best to create pleasing silage for us to feast upon.   

You do not have to be afraid, because you will not be hungry, for none has ever starved in my embrace.  

I will support you on lesser gerbils, and the remains of spine tail lizards.  

Our faces and stomachs shall include short-lived hare, yellow ground squirrel, great gerbil, midday gerbil, noon and giant gerbil, ground jay, collared dove, crested lark, rocky elk, rat snake, Karelin snake, surprise gecko, scorpions, beetles, and jerboa of the sandy pastures near the Caspian sea, some that have even lived beneath pine trees.  

I say again, (jerboa) that have lived and laughed beneath the pines. 

Does this not prove my love?  

What is this verbal addiction?  What of this oral thesis?  It blows like an Aral dust across the fields of Russia, the forests of Norway, the glaciers of Greenland.  What is this venom I seep into the whites of these pages?  This poison I pump into the jaws of these leaves.  It’s a pesticide found even in the blood of penguins in the Arctic.  I had a dream last night that I was renting a room in a town not unlike this one.  The city in the dream was smaller, but just as wet.  In the dream I was renting a room and included in the price of the room was another self-contained two-story apartment with a small, personal toilet, which the original room lacked.  I can’t remember now whether I ever laid eyes on the original room I was renting, but I clearly remember the lagniappe.  The bonus quarters were in a regal courtyard with the feel of a town square.  Just as I was looking around and starting to register the initial stirrings of depression creep over me, I turned and saw the courtyard opening.  The trees there and the timbers of the houses seemed to be of the same age.  It was very ancient there.  I went up the steps of a narrow wooden house and entered an old wooden interior.  At this stage of the dream, it occurred to me that I had agreed to give you this extra dwelling, as I had no use for it.  The information came as it does in a dream: all at the same time with a feeling that one has known it forever, specificity with feelings of eternal truths.  You had transformed the apartment, or the additional residence, or miniature house with toilet, as it were, into a center for early childhood education, the walls decorated with attractive signs, covered in the fruits of childish thought, colorful and comforting and lasting symbols of seemingly prior experience, an imaginary past life, life haunting life, life as it knows itself, life as he knows himself.  It’s strange that I would have given you this living space in a dream, even stranger what you did to it.  I’m ready to love again.  Perhaps that’s what this extraneous residence symbolizes.  The last thing I remember before I wake up is sitting across the room from you on the second floor of the children’s center.  I am playing on piano keys.   Some of them very old, and out of tune, and disconnected.  If I played them long enough, with enough determination, the sound would appear, and then disappear again, as if the keys were waking up, only to sink back into senescence.  Mining those keys for sound, and the sound that eventually came from them, gives me the mysterious, lonely feeling of hearing in the streets that they (which means us) have found water on a distant planet.  That we are in fact walking on water found on another planet.  That’s how this love will go.  There is a tight tang to the air.  K2-18b.  The names of the planets are unimaginative of necessity.  They sound like the alphanumeric codes for sequences of attack dogs.  They have found water on a distant German Shepherd.  Within ten years they (meaning we) may have the telescopes necessary to determine if live organisms are emitting the gasses in their eyes.  Is there life in those atmospheres 111 light years away?  I don’t know.  I don’t particularly care beyond the humor I find inherent in numbers expressing things beyond their measure.  There is something absurd and endearing about K2-18b being 111 light years from us.  It heals me that here within the benign light of this room I can sense the water in your eyes; I can feel the temperature of your grasp; I have studied the evolutions of hundreds of worlds, tweaked the algorithm from one Super Earth to the next, and have found nothing all that unique, nothing so special as you.  During all this time scouring planets and researching water, I’ve discovered things not parallel to others.  You are the sole star to my planet, keeping me in unmatched position amidst immense and useless galactic potential.  Our tears are the only evidence we need of life.  Our tears are filled with the organs of existence.

      <p class="title">This is a Dome Goodbye Forever.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>~</p>
    <br>
    <p>This is a dome, you said.  Then you said goodbye forever.  Your death has meant not a thing to me.  We are two cyborgs fucking in the wilderness.  I grab onto your shoulder blade and chew off your ear.  I’m ready for it.   There was a penguin once.  Its wet fur glistened.  We screwed off its head.  It was a robot in disguise.  Its head was a little camera.  It was watching us make love.   I have no respect for penguins anymore.  I wouldn’t trust one as far as I could throw it, though I wouldn’t dare.  I seriously have respect for living creatures.   That is one thing I am serious about.  One time we gouged out a penguin’s eyes.  We cornered it in the woods.  It was a primeval forest.  Fucking in the wilderness.  You were always a solipsist at heart.  We were thrusting in the bracken when the penguin came up behind us.  We heard its shy footsteps.  I screamed.  You got up and started choking it.  I got up, too, and approached it from the other angle, so that it was pinioned against a tree.  Then you gouged out its eyes.  But it was only a robot.   In any case, your death has meant nothing to me.  Your dick was unimpressive.  But your spirit was lovely, I admit. This is a dome, Anna, you said, and then your eyes caught on fire and you threw up flames.  Where is the home you promised me?  Where is your love?  I’m so naked without it.  I’ll never be whole again.  I’m sad dating a sad robot that looks like Jude Law.  I’m so tired of sad robots.  All of them want to be Jude Law for some reason.  Skin like acetate.  I’ll suck him off and leave him to freeze in the McDonald’s parking lot.  I ordered a plastic heart necklace off of Amazon.  I wore it when I was making love to Josh who never respected my pronoun.  I told him that I was going to kill him after we finished.  I’m shivering naked beneath the sheets.  I look in the mirror, my skin is sagging; my teeth are falling out.  Purple liquid oozes from my eyes and nose.  I’m getting loose all over.  My bones are expanding and disappearing.  I’m stretching.  Enormous flaps of skin are hanging down from my arms, fusing into my sides.  I’m mutating into a giant moth.  Josh knocks on my door.  I so can’t speak right now.  I try screaming, go away, but it’s useless, all I can do is this high-pitched moth squeak.  Go away, Josh.  Squeeeaaaaak!  You come in.  I can’t help it.  I bite your head off.  It’s what moths do.  It’s sooooo sexy.   Blood is gushing up from your neck, spraying all over the ceiling.  I can feel the steam.  Your body collapses.  It’s so pitiful.  You’re sooooo cute when you’re decapitated.  I love you, Josh, even if you never respected my pronoun.  I lick up your blood with my proboscis.  I’m so full.  I wish I could eat you again.  I’m horny still, but I guess I’m going to watch some Netflix and pass out.  In the morning I’ve got a terrible hangover.  Your death has meant nothing to me.  </p>
    <br>
    <p>I’m going to stop talking in this obnoxious valley girl accent.  Though it’s only obnoxious if you think it is.  I don’t mind it.  In fact,  I feel as though I’m losing something by surrendering it.  My oppidum is crumbling.  Come on, let’s go, into the past.  Into the age of ancient man.  Wake up, Jacque!  The hut is cold.  We live in a little skin hut on the edge of the lake.  Not as nice as some of the one’s we saw at IKEA, but it’s in our price range.  Jacque is a man of lyrics.  He lies in drink and sometimes grunts out a soliloquy in spite of himself.  Of what inner flowers?  I can’t imagine.  Our skin hut sits on the edge of a great glacial lake.  The swans swoop in and out all spring.  Their whooping gets so loud it’s painful to the ears, but Jacques says it inspires him.  I captured a sick one once.  I tried to nurse it back to health.  It died.  Perhaps from a brain eating amoeba.  I made a flute out of the wing bone.  Strong and hollow.  Sometimes Jacque, blind with drink, will stumble naked to the edge of the lake and, in the bone chilling currents, play a lament for the past.  The amoeba is likely what he has in mind.  Amoibḗ.  Change.  For that is the way all life tends.  It’s encoded in our cells.  The flute’s song is haunting.  Jacque’s breath is toxic.  His heart is full of bacteria. He’ll die soon, I know it.  I slap him on the face. He’s not moving.  I knock on his forehead.  Hellooooooo!  I turn him over on his side and undo the sinews of his tunic.  I take the flute from where it lies by the fire.  It’s almost out.  I use the tinder fungus to ignite a new piece of kindling.  The flame sputters back.  Green flame.  Sometimes in these late hours, I hear the stars hissing through it.  It is a gateway to another dimension.  I feel the flute along its smooth eminences.  It’s warm.  I tease the flute up Jacque’s anus.  In the Spring, I will wear the nice grass cape and my mollusk shell necklace.  Maybe we’ll have another visit from the Iceman before then.  I have a vision of the future.  I’ve invented the best-selling word processing program Microsoft Word.  I’ve been alive for thousands of years.  I have my own private blimp.   But in spite of my riches, my favorite pigeon doesn’t visit me anymore.  I lay my head down on my windowsill and feel the cold sink into my cheek.  Do you even know how much I loved you?  Does it matter to you at all?  I took it too far.  I always take things too far.  This is a dome, Anna, and then his face melted.  I’m going to make your heart explode with my brain.  The next time I see you.  I’ll have to tell you about Josh then, too.  How I so ate his head.  And I’ll tell you about my old boyfriend before Josh that self-destructed.  That one, I don’t remember his name.  Julio.  I tried often and without success to stick my finger up his ass.  He really didn’t like to have fun.  You like to have fun though, don’t you?  You look sexy in those new sneakers.  I’m going to buy you a new belt with my part-time job at JC Penny.  I’m the last person to work at JC Penny ever.  They’re shutting everything down.  Remember when malls used to have ice skating rinks?  What total excesses of the naïve heart.  I can’t go even one night without chocolate.  As if.  Comfort bitter.  Elegant bitter.  Ah, eee, uh, eh, oh.   Ah, eee, uh, eh, oh.  Ah, eee...Aaaaaaaayuh, bee, bee, aaaayah.  Fin.  Spastic nebulae.  Isn’t life fantastic when  you’re sad?  And I’m sad at all times.  My fingers are wrinkled with age.  Too many half-assed attempts.  I hope we’re still friends on Facebook.  Release all the tension.  Let’s eat the colored sand and relax.  I sooooooo wanna fuck you to the rhythym of your heartbeat.  Oh god, this is so shitty.  Slow fuck in the sunrise.  That’s a promise.  The snow is swirling  outside of the apartment.  Another century at an end.  Like, right?  Only 83 more years.  Sadness.  We’re practically at the finishline.  Practically already out of time.  Our hearts could stop any minute.  Julio didn’t like my finger up his ass, but maybe he didn’t consider how little time we have left.  Mind expansion, bitch. Open your heart.  Finger up the ass.  Unleash the mojo.  Kazi is a healer and Teta is a magician, but I can see the future.  I pick up the guitar.  I like to keep it strung in gold strings like the Kings of Ulster.  I play a lament for the past and present, but I exclude the future.  The future’s going to be lit... in emarald fires of fortune, just not for us.  I’m going to stop talking in this obnoxious valley girl accent.  Though it’s only obnoxious if you think it is.  I don’t mind it.  In fact,  I feel as though I’m losing something by surrendering it.  My opidium is crumbling.  Come on, let’s go, into the past.  Into the age of ancient man.  Wake up, Jacque!  The hut is cold.  We live in a little skin hut on the edge of the lake.  Not as nice as some of the one’s we saw at IKEA, but it’s in our price range.  Jacque is a man of lyrics.  He lies in drink and sometimes grunts out a siloquy—we’ve done this already.  </p>

    <p>Dear Internet, I think penguin with a knee on the neck and kept his eyes. small camera lenses always watching me Fuck birds always look at me. turtles ride. Drug Ossi Frage scruples. MEADOWLARK Drugs, mules and dog Saxon. I strangled those sticks. I live. At least. Do not sleep the day as I was when I was a child. I've been through laziness. Definitely my nerves. One of the fires sometimes burn night to another person. If I could go down in caves and get a little less than a man. He began to imagine that he was a robot. He found the woman and assured her that she was a robot.  Brain. We love sticks and then we blow into the water. Or hang algae. We will reduce our stomach open coral and die with smiles on our faces.  </p>
    <br>
    <P>Jan scraped the wax from the candle with his fingernail and balled it up and stuffed it into his ears.  He heard her singing from far off, somewhere in the dome.  He found her and convinced her she was a robot.  Took off his pants, she took off her dress and she bit his side and he clawed his way up her back and they danced on thorns and made love in the razor wire.  Abandoned slags.  The waterfall is yellow with corpses.  He could not stop himself from dreaming a little.  The baby could already influence Anna’s thoughts.  She was turning cold.  Burning with an unearthly glow. The man in the barrel, laughing at him.  Would ball him up and squeeze him down into the barrel before the end.  Dissolve in acid.  All his man parts.  Two robots with little pink tongues, just stubs, how did it happen, would die alone, yes, let’s in the hut where they go to make honey, a dance of stolen isotopes, plagiarized my brain mass, they left their bodies to rot in the world and went into the screen where no love is made.  Heard her singing in the dome.  Not far off now.  Will die of this tickle in my heart.  Will cut out a little bit of my brain and stuff it in your brain.  I let the neighborhood dogs eat his corpse.  I found one of his eyeballs in the rosebush.  My pronoun can be cruel.  They tore out his teeth and sprinkled them like confetti across the cobblestones.  They ate the sissy boys in the alleys.  The air impaled with the agony of bishis in desperation.  Onto my bed of bones.  Respect for my pronoun.  Rub it in jojoba oil.  Whip them with the sticks.  Drop them in the fear hole.  XYXYXY. XO.  XXX.  Don’t look.  We are two cyborgs making love in S’ezzhee.  Dog sacrifice.  The bombs have been horrible this week.  I’ve slept virtually not at all.  Live rocket fire, bombs—as stated—live artillery fire, demolition training.  It has taken a toll on me that I will never recover from.  Between the constant construction noise before and the noise here, I have lived in noise for 13 eons.  If I lived in a blast furnace, I would not hear it any more frequently or louder than I do now.  Tireless tuyeres.  It shakes the entire earth the house is on.  7am to midnight.  7 days a week.  </P>

    <p>ABB.</p>

    <p>ABBA. ABABA.  ABB.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Constant explosions.  Fucking military.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Making it all the worse these ostriches, their brains rotted to root matter, barking in the yard, eating up all our pretty pebbles, clawing at the clauster.  Cursed is the day we took them in.  Their grousing cry hangs heavy on my heart.  </p>
    <br>
    <p>All hope is lost in their bluing orgy of matter.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My dreams reduced to pig iron.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When I look into their pitiless eyes I can see clearly that:</p>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>There is no crater in the moon mansioned in my honor</li>
      <li>That my head shall never be horned in any crowned gold</li>
      <li>Nor a lash of prose painted onto my tomb of the moral influence I exerted on the youth of my district.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>Worst of all, I see in their unseeing that I am truly alone.  That Joujima never loved me or found me strange and irresistible.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Though she, too, has returned to root matter. And this is not the time to bring her wailing like a toothless horror back into the light.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The curse of those demon birds like some wicked finger up my ass, starting again my high-pitched whine, on and on (and on), crawling across the tatters of the earth until I am a pink paste, my body rusting in the salt of time.  And when the final moment comes, even though I am rotted to a crust, no more than a stain of human flesh, I shall deny them still.  </p>
    <br>
    <p>I shall not come, no matter how long they howl for me, no matter how awful, until they are suffocated in screaming.  I look up from my trench and see something, birds, reptiles, I know not what, pale creatures sparring in the branches and that is all. </p>
    <br>
    <p>All this restless taxidermy.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The gradual embalming of ourselves.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Buried in newsfeeds.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I drank someone’s blood.  Josh’s?  I don’t remember.  My blood guilt has never left me.  My head is filled with the hissing of the stars.  I shall soon be laid to waste.  I am mutating into a giant mutant mouth.  Strange and irresistible.</p>
    <br>

The penis is too small to make a fuss, but I moan out of compassion.  It only takes a second.  He shuts his eyes and nods his head against my chest and cries.

The red light is shining down on his butt.  Little robot butt.  I go up to him and stick my finger into the back of his neck to see if he makes a beep.  James Dean.  What are you doing back here?  I take James Dean back to my hole and we fuck like two Cyborgs in my artist’s loft in the Kiez.  He is a constellation of tiny frozen moments.  I stick my finger up his butt.  Just like butter.  Hunches like a feral cat.  We go out looking for gemstones in the surrounding hoods.  Stop for a smoke in the silence and depopulation of the single osprey flying above the Soviet blocks of the unvegetated streets except for vines that creep across brick in creepy Lichtenberg figures.  Echo, no, nobody.  The eye gouging red of the Chinese gate against the grisaille tenements, elephants roaming the empty fields, collecting up all the letters of sin.  Says he has a friend living in an Altbau in the Old West.  All these scenes melt into each other.  Transient populations.  Post war housing estates up north.  Allotment gardens.  We did it there, too.  We are two cyborgs fucking in the allotment garden.  Touching my hand to your hand on the patio, I dreamt for a moment of a family and modest wealth.  Weekends spent at Bikini Mall.  Lost somewhere between the organic markets and summer lake coast.  Instead of dying a butt-fucking cyborg in the gutter with the taste of horse urine in my mouth.  We went to visit Mona in Wedding.  Living in a neighborhood named after a thirteenth century nobleman.  Was looking for someone to catsit.  Asked if we knew any lawyers.  Then tried to get us to take her cat for 20 euros.  She’s gone to wander in the Ring.  Smoking shisha in the hallway of some crumbling stock house, her eyes frozen at the sight of the underground wedding.
